## Getting Started With Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI) v11 

This assumes you have access to an Eclipse version 11 computer that has the Eclipse Scripting API installed and the Eclipse Script Wizard Installed.

### 1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  
Professional or better version is preferred, but the Express (free) version will work just fine as well.  Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 also works well, but be aware that all Varian documentation is geared towards the "officially supported" version; 2010.

If needed, install the "Visual C# 2010 Express" installation.  The links below are fragile.  If they do not work for you, go to [msdn.microsoft.com](msdn.microsoft.com) and search for "download Visual C# 2010 Express".

: Higher level page for 2010 Express (Works best with Chrome):
:: [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express)

### 2. Find and read the ESAPI Reference Guide
Go to [https://my.varian.com](https://my.varian.com), find the Eclipse Scripting API Reference Guide and download it.

If the link above doesn't work, sign into [https://my.varian.com](https://my.varian.com) and search for "Scripting".

### 3. Start Scripting!
Quickly flip to page 15 of the ESAPI reference guide: "Chapter 4 Getting Started with the Eclipse Scripting API".  Continue on with Chapter 5 and the rest of the manual after you've run your first script.
